Executable name should be "montyhall"


Short Reaction: When I first saw the problem I was mostly confused at how it could be 2/3rds because it still seemed like a 50/50 until the problem was shown in depth in class which made me realize WHY exactly it was a 2/3rd chance if you switch and doing this assignment really strengthened that idea and helped me understand the why even more.
